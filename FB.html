				<h2>Introduction</h2>
			
				<p>Chemical Cleavage of Mismatches (CCM) is a technique that employs the ability of potassium permanganate (KMnO<sub>4</sub>) and hydroxylamine (NH<sub>2</sub>OH) 
				to preferentially react with thymine (T) and cytosine (C) bases, respectively, and open the pyrimidine ring according to the mechanism shown in Figure 1.</p>

				<h3>Figure 1. Reactions of KMnO<sub>4</sub> and NH<sub>2</sub>OH with pyrimidine bases.</h3>
				
				<p>In order to optimize the reaction conditions for cleaving the mismatches in DNA molecules immobilized on surface, first, a series of experiments were conducted on
				four different nucleoside monophosphates in solution. The goal of these experiments was to study the specificity and kinetics of the reactions of KMnO<sub>4</sub> and NH<sub>2</sub>OH with all four nucleobases.</p>
				
								
				<p>Conjugated aromatic rings in DNA bases absorb light with the maxima in the range between 260 and 280 nm. KMnO<sub>4</sub> and NH<sub>2</sub>OH are expected to break selectively 
				the aromaticity of thymine (T) and cytosine (C) nucleobases, respectively. Hence, one should observe a gradual decrease in absorbance as the corresponding reactions progress. 
				The kinetics of the reactions can be elucidated through monitoring the changes in the absorbance of free nucleoside monophosphates as a function of time.</p>
				
				<h2>Methods</h2>
				
				<p>Hydroxylamine (NH<sub>2</sub>OH), potassium permanganate (KMnO<sub>4</sub>), dimethylamine ((CH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>NH), sodium acetate (CH<sub>3</sub>COONa),
				thymidine 5-monophosphate disodium salt hydrate,
				2-deoxyguanosine 5-monophosphate sodium salt hydrate, 2-deoxycytidine 5-monophosphate sodium salt, and 2-deoxyadenosine 5-monophosphate were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich
				 and used without further purification. The concentrations of potassium permanganate and hydroxylamine in the reaction
				mixtures were 0.4 mM and 3.2 M, respectively. For the reactions, nucleoside monophosphates were dissolved in deionized water. Their concentrations were determined from the absorption
				data using the Lambert-Beer law. Hydroxylamine stock solution was prepared at 4.2 M concentration and pH was adjusted to 6 using dimethylamine. The final concentration
				of hydroxylamine in the reaction mixtures was 3.23 M. The absorption spectra were recorded on a Cary 50 Bio UV-Vis spectrophotometer (Varian).</p>
				
				<h2>Results and Discussion</h2>
				
				<p>The reactivity of hydroxylamine (NH<sub>2</sub>OH) and potassium permanganate (KMnO<sub>4</sub>) towards four different nucleoside monophosphates containing thymine, 
				cytosine, adenine, and guanine bases was investigated using UV-Vis spectroscopy. NH<sub>2</sub>OH and KMnO<sub>4</sub> were allowed to react with nucleoside monophosphates
				for different amounts of time. In the case of KMnO<sub>4</sub> the reaction was stopped using 1 M sodium acetate solution (pH 5.2). The absorption spectra of 
				thymidine 5-monophosphate before and after reacting with KMnO<sub>4</sub> are presented in Figure 2.</p>

				<p>A gradual decrease in the absorption of thymine bases is observed as the reaction of KMnO4 is allowed to proceed for longer periods of time. 
				This observation is consistent with KMnO4 opening the thymidine ring of the base and destroying its aromaticity.</p>
				
				<p></p>

				<p>We found little to no effect of KMnO4 on the absorbance of other nucleoside monophosphates. Some reactivity was observed for cytosine. The summary of the results is presented in Figure 3.</p>

				<p>NH<sub>2</sub>OH showed very high specificity towards cytosine (Figure 5). However, the reaction is much slower compared to the reaction of KMnO<sub>4</sub> with thymine bases.</p>

				<p>For the second order reaction</p>
				
				<img src="FB5.jpg" alt="Eq1">
				
				<p>the rate equation is given by</p>
				
				<img src="FB6.jpg" alt="Eq2">
				
				<p>where k is the rate constant of the reaction, [A<sub>1</sub>]<sub>0</sub> and [A<sub>2</sub>]<sub>0</sub> are the initial concentrations of the reactants, and x is a variable defined as</p>
				
				<img src="FB7.jpg" alt="Eq3">
				
				<p>At time t = 0, [B]<sub>0</sub> = 0. Using these initial conditions and integrating the rate equation one can obtain</p>
				
				<p><img src="FB8.jpg" alt="Eq4"></p>
				<p><img src="FB9.jpg" alt="Eq5"></p>
				
				<p>We used the previous equation to fit the experimental data obtained for the reaction of KMnO<sub>4</sub> with thymine and the reaction of NH<sub>2</sub>OH with cytosine. [A<sub>1</sub>] in the equation represents the
				concentrations of the bases calculated from the absorption data using the Lambert-Beer law. The results are presented in Figure 5 and 6. From the fit, the reaction rate constants were determined to be 
				24.6 M<sup>-1</sup>sec<sup>-1</sup> for the reaction of KMnO<sub>4</sub> with thymine and 0.3 M<sup>-1</sup>sec<sup>-1</sup> for the reaction of NH<sub>2</sub>OH with cytosine.</p>

				<p>The obtained results were used to design experiments in more complex systems where each reagent was used to cleave dsDNA by reacting with appropriate bases in strands containing single C-C or T-T mutations. Those experiments are described in next sections.</p>
