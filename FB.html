				<h2>Introduction</h2>
			
				<p>Chemical Cleavage of Mismatches (CCM) is a technique that employs the ability of potassium permanganate (KMnO<sub>4</sub>) and hydroxylamine (NH<sub>2</sub>OH) 
				to preferentially react with thymine (T) and cytosine (C) bases, respectively, and open the pyrimidine ring according to the mechanism shown in Figure 1.</p>

				<h3>Figure 1. Reactions of KMnO<sub>4</sub> and NH<sub>2</sub>OH with pyrimidine bases.</h3>
				
				<p>In order to optimize the reaction conditions for cleaving the mismatches in DNA molecules immobilized on surface, first, a series of experiments were conducted on
				four different nucleotides in solution. The goal of these experiments was to study the specificity and kinetics of the reactions of KMnO<sub>4</sub> and NH<sub>2</sub>OH with all four nucleobases.</p>
				
								
				<p>Conjugated aromatic rings in DNA bases absorb light with the maxima in the range between 260 and 280 nm. KMnO<sub>4</sub> and NH<sub>2</sub>OH are expected to break selectively 
				the aromaticity of thymine (T) and cytosine (C) nucleobases, respectively. Hence, one should observe a gradual decrease in absorbance as the corresponding reactions progress. 
				The kinetics of the reactions can be elucidated through monitoring the changes in the absorbance of free nucleoside monophosphates as a function of time.</p>

				<h2>Results and Discussion</h2>
				
				<p>The reactivity of hydroxylamine (NH<sub>2</sub>OH) and potassium permanganate (KMnO<sub>4</sub>) towards four different nucleoside monophosphates containing thymine, 
				cytosine, adenine, and guanine bases was investigated using UV-Vis spectroscopy. NH<sub>2</sub>OH and KMnO<sub>4</sub> were allowed to react with nucleoside monophosphates
				for different amounts of time. In the case of KMnO<sub>4</sub> the reaction was stopped using 1 M sodium acetate solution (pH 5.2). The absorption spectra of 
				thymidine 5-monophosphate before and after reacting with KMnO<sub>4</sub> are presented in Figure 2.</p>

					reaction was allowed to proceed for 1, 5, 11.5, 15, 18, 21.5, 25, 35 minutes.</h3>

				<p>A gradual decrease in the absorption of thymine bases is observed as the reaction of KMnO4 with results is allowed to proceed for longer periods of time. 
				This observation is consistent with KMnO4 opening the thymidine ring of the base and destroying its aromaticity.</p>
				
				<p></p>

				<p>We found little to no effect of KMnO4 on the absorbance of other nucleoside monophosphates. Some reactivity was observed for cytosine. The summary of the results is presented in Figure 3.</p>

				<p>NH2OH showed very high specificity towards cytosine (Figure 4). However, the reaction is much slower compared to the reaction of KMnO4 with thymine bases.</p>
