				<p>Music has consistently been an important element of all human life despite differences in technology, culture, geographic location and time in history. 
				Each musical composition is made of seven basic notes and it is the specific sequence of these notes that gives each piece its own identity. These patterns
				or collections of sounds can play an active role influencing day-to-day life. Similarly, DNA is the fundamental molecule that is present across nearly all 
				forms of life on earth. DNA strands are composed of four primary bases that can be arranged into countless permutations. The order of these building blocks
				comprises the unique genetic codes that determine all organism's characteristics. For both music and DNA, the modification of a single elementary unit can 
				have significant implications. When a single musical note is out of place, the entire piece can sound awkward or “off”. Likewise, when a single DNA base at 
				a key position along the DNA strand is replaced by another (called a point mutation), a genetic abnormality results. These genetic abnormalities have the potential
				to cause various diseases, and therefore, identification of these specific point mutations is of great interest.</p>
				
				<p>How do we recognize that there is an altered piece of information in a given set of data? In the case of music, our brains can be trained to pick up 
				on these errors. Some psychologists believe that once we locate a problem spot in a pattern, our brain attempts to run through several possibilities of what the
				pattern would be like without the irregularity. Once an appropriate substitute is found, we can confirm to ourselves that the original pattern is incorrect. 
				This is demonstrated here using the classical music piece “Seasons” by Antonio Vivaldi. Although there is just a single out-of-place note, a non-expert can 
				easily hear the awkwardness in the first 3 samples. As our brain scans across the pattern, it interprets one of two possible outcomes for each note in the sequence.
				A note can be interpreted as correct (“1”) or out-of-place (“0”). This is known as a binary output and our brain responds to it automatically whenever we perceive 
				information as a pattern.</p>

				<p>Unlike detecting a misplayed note, recognizing mutations in a DNA sequence requires specific tools. One challenge of detecting these mutations arises from
				the limited amount of genetic material available for analysis – a drop of blood only contains about an attomole (10<sup>-18</sup> moles) of DNA. For this reason, a lot of biosensors
				require a signal amplification step, which most commonly utilizes enzymes and thereby requires very specific pH and temperature conditions.</p>
				
				<p>For our project we have built a nanobiosensor that can identify and localize specific mutations in a DNA strand without sequence amplification. This eliminates the need for 
				time-consuming techniques (such as polymerase chain reaction) and the requirement of sequencing an entire DNA strand to identify the mutation. We accomplished this by combining 
				chemical cleavage of mismatch reactions and a technique called dip pen nanolithography (DPNL). The nanosensor is designed to generate a binary code for each base position along 
				the strand of interest. This binary sequence is then interpreted to produce an unambiguous answer to whether there is a mutation at the site of interest and what the mutated base is.</p>
				
				<p>This is how the nanobiosensor works.</p>

				<p>Consider a single stranded DNA (ssDNA) of a known sequence, referred to here as the “target”. For this sequence, a specific mutation at 
				position 33 is indicative of a genetic disease, which the nanobiosensor needs to identify. In order to achieve this, we first immobilize the “bait” strands on surface using 
				dip pen nanolithography.</p>

				<p>The baits are fully complementary to the targets except for the point of interest. In our example it is position 33. The nucleobase in the bait 
				strand at the point of interest is replaced with a cytosine base (C). The 3` end of the modified bait strand is functionalized with a fluorophore (ATTO488) and the 5` end 
				with an amino group. 5’ modification allows us to chemically attach the baits to the epoxy-coated glass substrate.</p>

				<p>After the printing process is complete, solution containing the targets is incubated with the baits printed on surface. The baits are tightly packed on surface in sub-micron isles and,
				therefore, their local concentration is very high. Hybridization of the targets with the baits effectively pulls the target molecules from solution and concentrates them in the printed 
				sub-micron isles. Thus, even samples containing DNA at a very low concentration can be analyzed using the nanobiosensor.</p>

				<p>At the site of a potential mutation (position 33 in our example), we may have 4 possible base pairings that need to be identified: C-T, C-C, C-A or C-G
				(keep in mind that the nucleobase in the bait strand was intentionally changed to C prior to printing).</p>
				
				<p>In order to generate a binary code that is uniquely identifies the base pairing, three different isles are subjected to three different treatments that may nick
				the DNA at position 33. The first isle is incubated with hydroxylamine (NH<sub>2</sub>OH) , which nicks a cytosine base if there is a mismatch. This isle is then incubated
				with piperidine which cuts the DNA backbone in both strands if the mismatch is C-C or cuts only the bait strand. In the former case (illustrated below) the emission is lost.
				In the latter case, only the backbone of the bait strand is cut. This does not lead to de-hybridization and, therefore, the emission is preserved.</p>
				
				<div class="center">

				</div>
				
								
				<p>The second isle is incubated with NH<sub>2</sub>OH followed by incubation with potassium permanganate (KMnO<sub>4</sub>). KMnO<sub>4</sub> is specific to mismatched thymine bases.
				Thus, if there is a mismatched C or T nucleobase, those bases will be nicked. The piperidine will then cut the DNA backbone of the strands with nicked bases. Here is an example of how it works with a C-T mismatch:</p>
				
				<div class="center">
				<img src="CT_mod.jpg" alt="C-T modification">
				</div>
				
				<p>The third isle is incubated with NH2OH. It will create a nick in the mismatched C base if there is one at position 33. The piperidine treatment will cut the DNA backbone 
				if the base(s) got nicked. The piperidine treatment is followed by exposing the isle to an elevated temperature that is below the melting point of the whole DNA molecule 
				but above the melting point of the fragment that might have been cleaved. Thus, heat is used to de-hybridize only the DNA fragments of the cleaved strands. Here is an example of how it works with a C-C mismatch:</p>
				
				<div class="center">
				<img src="CA_mod.jpg" alt="C-T modification">
				</div>
				
				<p>If the base pair at the site of possible mutation is C-C, all three tests will cut the DNA strand at that point (due to the presence of hydroxylamine in all three tests)
				resulting in the loss of fluorescence. We designate this outcome as “0” in the binary code. So the overall signal obtained from all three isles reads “0-0-0”</p>

				</div>
				
				<p>If the base pair in position 33 is C-T, the first test only nicks the DNA strand without cleaving it, as a result, no fluorescence is lost. We designate this outcome as “0” in the binary code. 
				The second test cleaves the strand at position 33, resulting in the loss of fluorescence. The last test nicks and de-hybridizes the DNA strand, resulting in the loss of emission as well. Thus, the output signal
				for a C-T mismatch reads “1-0-0”.</p>
				
				<div class="center">
				<video width="960" controls autoplay loop>
					<source src="ct_vid.mp4" type="video/mp4">
					Your browser does not support the video tag.
				</video>
				</div>
				
				<p>If the position 33 base pair is C-A, we can expect no loss of fluorescence for the first test (specific for C-C) or second test (specific for C-C or C-T).
				The third test would lead to the loss of fluorescence through nicking and de-hybridizing the DNA strand at the site of the mutation. The output signal for a C-A base mismatch reads “1-1-0”.</p>
				
				<div class="center">
				<video width="960" controls autoplay loop>
					<source src="ca_vid.mp4" type="video/mp4">

				</div>
				
				<p>The last possible base pair combination that needs identification is C-G. Since cytosine and guanine are complementary bases, they do not form a bulge at position 33 and are not nicked by either NH4OH or KMnO4.
				Consequently, piperidine does not cut the strands in any of the three tests. As a result, fluorescence is not lost in any of the isles and the output signal reads “1-1-1” for a C-G base pair combination.</p>

				<p>Thus, the nanosensor generates binary codes that are uniquely associated with bases present at a given position in the target strands.</p>
