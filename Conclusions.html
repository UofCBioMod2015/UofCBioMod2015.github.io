				<h2>Summary</h2>
				
				<p>We have succeeded in immobilizing DNA on a solid support in sub-micron isles using dip pen nanolithography. This design is particularly attractive for the use in
				a DNA nanosensor as it allows performing the analysis of very diluted samples. When the target DNA strands are incubated with the isles that contain complementary bait strands, 
				the targets get pulled out of solution and concentrate in the isles as a result of hybridization making the detection process easier.</p>
				
				<p>We have studied the kinetics of the reactions of potassium permanganate (KMnO<sub>4</sub>) and hydroxylamine (NH<sub>2</sub>OH) with four different nucleoside monophosphates in solution 
				and confirmed that these compounds preferentially react with thymine (T) and cytosine (C) bases, respectively. They modify the bases by opening the pyrimidine ring.</p>
								
				<p>After establishing selectivity of the chemical base modification reactions, we proceeded to optimize cleavage of mismatched bases in dsDNA molecules. More specifically, we showed that 
				KMnO<sub>4</sub> is capable of targeting and modifying mismatched thymine bases in dsDNA while piperidine is capable of cleaving the strands at the sites where the bases were nicked.</p>
				
				<p>Finally we demonstrated that these chemical cleavage procedures could be used to cleave mismatches in dsDNA that are immobilized on solid support. Utilizing a confocal microscope, measuring
				the intensity of the fluorescence signals originating from the printed isles, and assigning binary values to the detected fluorescence signal allowed us to generate a binary code that is uniquely 
				associated with the nucleobase at the site of interest on the target strand.</p>
				
				
				<h2>Future applications</h2>
				
				<p>Moving forward, we believe that this detection model has potential to be used in a microfluidic device.</p>

				<p>DPNL enables massive parallelization allowing testing multiple positions in a DNA strand for potential point mutations. The animation above is intended to illustrate this point.
				Bait strands of different sequences along the channels and same sequences across the channels can be printed using DPNL. Each microfluidic channel represents one of the 3 chemical cleavage
				treatments used in our project (1 - NH<sub>2</sub>OH, 2 - NH<sub>2</sub>OH + KMnO<sub>4</sub>, 3 - NH<sub>2</sub>OH + Heat). 
				Three parallel DNA dots printed across the microfluidic channels are required to test for one potential mutation. As for the number of dots printed along the channels, modern DPNL systems can print thousands 
				of them simultaneously. We believe that implementation of this
				design has the potential for improving both the accuracy and efficiency of genetic diagnostics, ultimately enhancing medical treatment of genetic conditions.</p>
